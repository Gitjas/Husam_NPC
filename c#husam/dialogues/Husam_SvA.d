Husam in BGII

(post from redline at BeamDog forums) "Personality-wise, we don't have much to go on from the first game, but it seems like he could potentially bring a bit of cold professionalism to the party, which could be a welcome counterweight to the self-righteousness/self-pity/sociopathy most of the other NPCs offer." 


compatibility: "C#HUSAM.cre" is used by bg1re
bg1re: BG1 AR0153.are - "C#HUSAM" has to DestroySelf() in case the PC didn't talk to him

BG1: one of his states let him stand in the Thieves' Guild at first meeting. Fix this with
