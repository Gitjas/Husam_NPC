# Husam_NPC
Adds Husam, the Shadow Thief from BG1, as a joinable NPC in SoD and BGII. Please note: BGII content is not finished.

## General Info
Husam is a Shadow Thief from Amn, who was sent in BG1 to make sure the accusations against his guild regarding the murders where proven to be wrong. In the original game, he reveals himself to the PC near the end of BG1 and guides the PC to the real culprits.
The mod contains 3 components:

Component 1 is the main component that will insert Husam as an NPC into SoD and BGII. All other components are dependent on this one but optional.

As a second, optional component, the mod's portrait and soundset can be assigned to the original game Husam, as well. This will not change his very first line if met while he is still pretending to be drunk.

The 3rd component installs the crossmod with other mods and should be installed late.

Please note: For Husam to react to game events in SoD accordingly, the main component (Tracking System, 2nd component) of "Road to Discovery" needs to be included in your install (independent of install order).

## Where to meet in Game
In SoD, Husam will be standing in the BG East area (where Sorcerous Sundries is located), in the north at the bench. He will not approach the PC by himself.
Note that Husam will only appear if the PC worked with him in BG1 (or a new SoD game).

In BGII, he will be in Mae'Var's hideout.

## Content
Husam comes with friendship talks, own quest, and banters with some NPCs, and player initiated dialogues. In SoD, the latter offers the possibility to ask Husam about information with regard to Caelar's crusade. His "information services" are such that he will not spoil any details by himself, but only if the PC asks him directly. In SoD, Husam joins the PC to get firsthand information about the coalition - and the PC himself, about which he communicates completely open. In BGII, Husam will have lost his loyal rogues to Mae'Var and Irenicus. He will join the PC for revenge.

So far, only the SoD content of the mod is finished. In BGII, Husam can be taken into the group and kicked out, will not accept working for Bodhi (and defend the thieves' guild in the upcoming fight), and he will react to the thief's stronghold questline.
